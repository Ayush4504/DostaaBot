This is a chatbot which was created as a 4th semester's final project. This project is made by Pratyush Jagtap (owner of this repository), Ayush Ghotkar and Obban Kachroo (fellow collaborators).
Our chatbot uses G4F and Gradio as building blocks of the model and UI. Moreover, it even has a dedicated engine for those who want to seek inspiration for writing a story titled "DostaaBot but a writer".
Also, this chatbot has a flag feature which can be used by users who find some content offensive or inappropriate and can directly report it to us creators.
