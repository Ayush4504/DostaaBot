A story where Spider-man gets exposed to gamma radiations and turns to Spider-Hulk?,"Once upon a time in the bustling city of New York, Peter Parker, also known as Spider-Man, swung through the streets, keeping a vigilant eye out for crime. But one fateful night, during a battle with a group of supervillains, a malfunctioning gamma radiation device exploded nearby.

Caught in the blast, Spider-Man was showered with gamma radiation. At first, he felt a surge of energy coursing through his veins, but soon he began to notice changes. His muscles bulged and expanded, his strength intensified, and an uncontrollable rage bubbled within him.

Terrified by his transformation, Spider-Man sought help from his friend and fellow scientist, Bruce Banner, also known as the Hulk. Bruce examined Spider-Man's condition and explained that the gamma radiation had mutated his DNA, granting him powers similar to those of the Hulk.

As Spider-Man struggled to control his newfound strength and anger, he grappled with the responsibility of wielding such power. With Bruce's guidance, he learned to harness his abilities for good, becoming the heroic Spider-Hulk.

But being both Spider-Man and the Hulk came with its own set of challenges. Spider-Hulk had to navigate the delicate balance between his human side and the raging monster within. He also faced scrutiny from both allies and enemies who feared his immense power.

Despite the hardships, Spider-Hulk continued to protect the city, using his unique blend of agility, intelligence, and raw strength to thwart villains and save innocent lives. And as he swung through the city skyline, a new legend was born — the incredible Spider-Hulk, defender of New York City.",,,2024-05-08 12:18:40.501620
